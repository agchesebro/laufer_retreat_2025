# Laufer Retreat Talk 2025

These are the references for the slides for my talk at the Laufer Center Retreat 04-22-25. There are also some links to additional resources for interested audience members. I try to include code or link to existing repositories for the slides I show, but as I noted in the talk some of the content is still private and will be released sometime in the next month or so. If you're interested and don't see those updates, feel free to reach out to me at anthony.chesebro@stonybrook.edu.
